/**
 * Lifecycle events that can be emitted by Activities.
 *
 * ### Ordering semantics
 *
 * This class implements [Comparable], but it does **not** override `equals`, so even though the
 * following holds:
 * ```
 * val a = createOnCreateEvent(null)
 * val b = createOnCreateEvent(Bundle())
 * assertThat(a <= b).isTrue()
 * assertThat(b <= a).isTrue()
 * ```
 *
 * The equality does not hold:
 * ```
 * assertThat(a == b).isFalse()
 * ```
 *
 * This happens because events of type [CREATE][ActivityLifecycleEvent.Type.CREATE] hold a [Bundle],
 * and even though any two `CREATE` events are equal in ordering ([compareTo]), they are never equal
 * in [equals] comparison.
 *
 * In mathematical terms, the activity events set form a
 * [total preorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_ordering#Total_preorders), but *not* a
 * [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order): it is reflexive, transitive, strongly
 * connected, but **not** antisymmetric.
