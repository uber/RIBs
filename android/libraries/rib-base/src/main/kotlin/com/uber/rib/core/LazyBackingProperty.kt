/**
 * Lazily sets a value produced by [initializer] into the receiver mutable property and returns it
 * if the property is set to `null`, or returns the value set into the property without calling
 * [initializer].
 *
 * This is similar to [lazy].
 *
 * This function is needed because of Mockito mocking. When we mock a class, mockito does not call
 * any constructor and does not initialize private fields of the class. By having a null (unset)
 * field being dynamically set by a final function, we can overcome this issue.
 *
 * To properly support concurrency, the backing mutable property should be [Volatile].
